1. New Rails Project : Iteration 0
2. Add owner : boolean to Doctor model. Bootstrap the owner.

Name - max 35 characters; required
Address
City
State
Zip - max 5 digits
School - Received Degree From
Years in Practice - must be value between 1-100

rails g model doctor name adddress city state zip school experience:integer

class CreateDoctors < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :doctors do |t|
      t.string :name, :limit => 35
      t.string :address
      t.string :city
      t.string :state
      t.string :zip, :limit => 5
      t.string :school
      t.integer :experience
      t.boolean :owner, :default => false

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end


rails db:migrate

seeds.rb


Doctor.create(name: 'Dick', 
              address: '1234 Main Street', 
              city: 'Atlanta', 
              state: 'GA', 
              zip: '94085', 
              school: 'School of Animals', 
              experience: 10,
              owner: true)

3. Owner can manage vet doctor info

rails g controller doctors index show new 

Validation tests for the doctor model.

Implement index and show page.

Create and update done

To be continued:

Implement the use case for receptionist.

Appointment record:

Date of Visit - date cannot be in the past; value is required
Pet - required
Customer -required
Requires Reminder of Appointment        boolean checkbox
Reason for Visit – required             textfield


Before appointment, we need to implement #3.


3. As one of the practicing veterinary doctors, I should be able to record the following information about a customer's pet.
Name of Pet - required, no more than 35 characters
Type of Pet - must be a dog, cat, or bird
Breed - required, no more than 35 characters
Age - required
Weight - required
Date of Last Visit – required

rails g scaffold pet name breed age:integer weight:integer last_visit:datetime

rails db:migrate

rails g migration add_pet_type_to_pets type:string

class Pet < ApplicationRecord
   CATEGORY = ["Dog", "Cat", "Bird"]
   
   validates :name, presence: true
   validates :age, presence: true
   validates :weight, presence: true
   validates :last_visit, presence: true
   
   validates :breed, presence: true
   validates :breed, length: { maximum: 35 }
end


Make null false for:

class CreatePets < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :pets do |t|
      t.string :name, null: false
      t.string :breed, null: false
      t.integer :age, null: false
      t.integer :weight, null: false
      t.datetime :last_visit, null: false

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

The single-table inheritance mechanism failed to locate the subclass: 'Dog'. This error is raised because the column 'type' is reserved for storing the class in case of inheritance. Please rename this column if you didn't intend it to be used for storing the inheritance class or overwrite Pet.inheritance_column to use another column for that information.

class AddPetTypeToPets < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    add_column :pets, :category, :string
  end
end


  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :category %>
    <%= f.select(:category, Pet::CATEGORY) %>
  </div>


Pets resource done.
